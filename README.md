# Walking Around
Walking Around is a graph to show my source of information that grows with new people, books, etc. since October 2021. The aim is to see the connections that are subjective. For instance, It doesn't show the all books or authors that are included in the blog. It only shows the new sources that I am interested in.

A web component called 3D Force-Directed Graph is used to show the graph data structure in 3D.
